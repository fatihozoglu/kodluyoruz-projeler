                                typically has six strings. It is held flat against the player's body and played by
                                strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing
                                selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or
                                individual finger picks may be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is
                                projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or
                                amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.</div>

                                aria-labelledby="list-profile-list">The drum is a member of the percussion group of
                                musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a
                                membranophone.[1] Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum
                                skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's
                                hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. There is usually a resonance head
                                on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top
                                drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the
                                thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and
                                the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.[1]</div>

                                aria-labelledby="list-messages-list">The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a
                                wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow
                                wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the
                                family in regular use.[a] The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in
                                perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow
                                across its strings. It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers
                                (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of
                                the bow (col legno).</div>

                                aria-labelledby="list-settings-list">The flute is a family of musical instruments in the
                                woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or
                                reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening.
                                According to the instrument classification of Hornbostelâ€“Sachs, flutes are categorized
                                as edge-blown aerophones.[1] A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a
                                flute player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist.</div>
